# Smash App To-Do List
- Implement storage (probably Core Data) to save League reports.
- Start thinking about overall app structure - saving preferred `Player` in `NSUserDefaults` perhaps.
- Build a proper view controller that takes a `LeagueSession` and a `preferredPlayer` and shows the results, based on Sketch mock-up.
