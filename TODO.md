# Smash App To-Do List
- `Parser` needs to parse final `Player` ratings
- `GroupResult` needs to store final `Player` ratings
- Finish clearly defining the `GroupResult` public interface vs. private implementation
- Define `LeagueSession` public interface
- Mock up another prototype that takes in a `LeagueSession` and a preferred `Player` and shows the table view appropriately
