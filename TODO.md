# Smash App To-Do List
- `Parser` should also be able to parse list of league sessions.
- Start looking at proper networking to download a given league session report to parse.
- Start thinking about overall app structure - saving preferred `Player` in `NSUserDefaults` perhaps.
- Build a proper view controller that takes a `LeagueSession` and a `preferredPlayer` and shows the results, based on Sketch mock-up.
